# Pic10C_Chelsea
repository for all assignments from the PIC10C class

I had some difficulties figuring how out how to do a merge commit.

I've tried my best to update it every 30 minutes. I have to be brutally honest, I don't really like this version control software. I really prefer working on it in visual studios or some other compiler and this is starting to get really frustrating expecially since I'm having trouble with cloning both branches when I clone my repositories.

I'm going to start commenting on my files a bit.
